# Puppet Modules for WSO2 API Manager

This repository contains the Puppet modules for profiles related to WSO2 API Manager. 



## Supported Puppet Versions

- Puppet 8.x.x

## Manifests in a module

Located in the modules directory, each subfolder represents a Puppet module for a specific API Manager profile or shared logic:

- ```apim```: Main API Manager (default profile).
- ```apim_gateway```: Gateway profile for handling API traffic.
- ```apim_control_plane```: Control Plane profile for API publishing, management, and key management.
- ```apim_tm```: Traffic Manager profile for throttling and rate limiting.
- ```apim_common```: Shared logic, parameters, and files used by all profiles.

![Module architecture](docs/images/module_architecture.png "Module architecture")

The run stages for Puppet are described in `<puppet_environment>/manifests/site.pp`, and they are of the order Main -> Custom.

Each Puppet module manifest contains the following .pp files.
* Main
    * ```params.pp```: Contains all the parameters necessary for the main configuration and template.
    * ```init.pp```: Contains the main script of the module.
* Custom
    * ```custom.pp```: Used to add custom configurations to the Puppet module.

## General Confiuration Steps

1.Preparing the Puppet Environment:

Before starting the configuration steps, Puppet environment should be created and the necessary modules, manifests, and scripts should be added:

 -  **Clone or copy this repository into the Puppet environment directory**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wso2/puppet-apim.git
    ```
- Ensure all required modules and manifests ( `apim`, `apim_gateway`, `apim_control_plane`, `apim_tm`, and `apim_common`) are present in the `modules` directory.

- Edit the agent's ```puppet.conf``` to use this copied/cloned directory as the environment.

> **Note:**  
> In the following instructions, the prepared Puppet environment directory will be referred to as `<puppet_environment>`.

2. Download a product package. Product packages can be downloaded and copied to the directory manually, or downloaded from a remote location. Depending on the approach follow the relevant instruction.
    * **Manual Approach**: Download wso2am-4.4.0.zip from [here](https://github.com/wso2/product-apim/releases/download/v4.4.0/wso2am-4.4.0.zip) and copy it to the `<puppet_environment>/modules/apim_common/files/packs` directory in the **Puppetmaster**.
    * **Download from Remote**:
        1. Change the value *$pack_location* variable in `<puppet_environment>/modules/apim_common/manifests/params.pp` to `remote`.
        2. Change the value *$remote_pack* variable of the relevant profile in `<puppet_environment>/modules/apim_common/manifests/params.pp` to the URL in which the package should be downloaded from, and remove it as a comment.
<br>
3. Set up the JDK distribution as follows:

   The Puppet modules for WSO2 products use Amazon Corretto as the JDK distribution. However, you can use any [supported JDK distribution](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/install-and-setup/setup/reference/product-compatibility/#tested-jdks). Similar to the product pack, the JDK Distribution can also be downloaded and copied to the directory manually, or can be downloaded from a remote location.
   * **Manual Approach**: Download Amazon Corretto for Linux x64 from [here](https://corretto.aws/downloads/resources/17.0.6.10.1/amazon-corretto-17.0.6.10.1-linux-x64.tar.gz) and copy .tar into the `<puppet_environment>/modules/apim_common/files/jdk` directory.
   * **Download from Remote**: Change the value *$remote_jdk* variable in `<puppet_environment>/modules/apim_common/manifests/params.pp` to the URL in which the JDK should be downloaded from, and remove it as a comment.
   * To use a different jdk distribution, reassign the *$jdk_name* and the *$java_home* variables in `<puppet_environment>/modules/apim_common/manifests/params.pp` accordingly.
<br>

4. Depending on the Deployment Pattern going to be followed, add the necessary configurations in the modules in the **puppet server**. 

    - For that, populate the `params.pp` and the `deployment.toml.erb` within each module. Follow the Official APIM Documentation to find the required configurations that should be there in the deployment.toml for each profile.

5. In the **agents**, the profile that is desired to be configured on it should be added and this can be done in two ways. 

    ##### a. Using an Environment Variable (Ephemeral)

    Set the profile for just the current session or command run. <i>**Note that this only applies for that session or command execution.**</i>

    ```bash
    export FACTER_profile=<PROFILE_NAME>
    puppet agent -vt
    ```


    ##### b. Using an External Fact File (Persistent)

    Create a file on the agent to always set the profile. This way it will persist across reboots and all agent runs.

    ```bash
    echo "profile=<PROFILE_NAME>" | sudo tee /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/profile.txt
    puppet agent -vt
    ```

    Following are the ```PROFILE_NAME``` values that can be added depending on which profile that is intended to run on a particular **puppet agent**.
    
    - For Default Profile (All-in-one):
        ```bash
        profile=apim
        ```

    - Gateway profile:
       ```bash
       profile=apim_gateway
       ```
    - Control Plane profile:
       ```bash
       profile=apim_control_plane
       ```
    - Traffic Manager profile:
       ```bash
       profile=apim_tm
       ```
    
6. After configuring the profile, to pull the configurations and run the relevant profile on the **puppet agent**.
    ```bash
    puppet agent -vt
    ```

    After running the profile, check the status of the service to ensure it is up and running.

## Performance Tuning
System configurations can be changed through Puppet to optimize OS level performance. Performance tuning can be enabled by changing `$enable_performance_tuning` in `<puppet_environment>/modules/apim_common/manifests/params.pp` to `true`.

System files that will be updated when performance tuning is enabled are available in `<puppet_environment>/modules/apim_common/files/system`. Update the configuration values according to the requirements of your deployment.

## Common Issues & Possible Fixes

1. **Permissions Issues:**
The service runs as ```User=wso2carbon``` and ```Group=wso2```. Make sure ```/mnt/apim/wso2am-4.4.0/``` and all its contents are owned by ```wso2carbon:wso2``` and are writable by that user.
    
    <i>**Fix:**</i>
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R wso2carbon:wso2 /mnt/<PROFILE_NAME>/wso2am-4.4.0
    sudo chmod -R 755 /mnt/<PROFILE_NAME>/wso2am-4.4.0
    ```
<br>

2. **JAVA_HOME Not Set or Java Not Installed:**
The script expects JAVA_HOME to be set (it is set in the script, but make sure /opt/java exists and points to a valid JDK). Make sure Java is installed and accessible to the wso2carbon user.

    <i>**Fix:**</i>
    ```bash
    sudo -u wso2carbon /opt/java/bin/java -version
    ```
    - If this fails, check your JDK installation and symlink.
<br>

3. **Script Fails Silently:**
The api-manager.sh script may exit early due to a missing dependency or misconfiguration, so the PID file is never created.

    <i>**Fix:**</i>
    - Try running the script manually as the wso2carbon user and see if it starts or prints errors:
        ```bash
        sudo -u wso2carbon /mnt/<PROFILE_NAME>/wso2am-4.4.0/bin/api-manager.sh start
        ```
    - Check for errors in ```/mnt/<PROFILE_NAME>/wso2am-4.4.0/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log``` or similar log files.
<br>

4. **Systemd Type Mismatch:**
The service is defined as ```Type=forking```, which expects the script to fork and leave a process running in the background, and to write a PID file. If the script does not fork or does not write the PID file, systemd will kill it.

    <i>**Fix:**</i>
    > Confirm that the script actually forks and writes the PID file.
